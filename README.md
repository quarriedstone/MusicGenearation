Music generation using evolutionary algorithm approach

Algorithm generates music using random MIDI notes and then iteratively tries to maximize fitness score. Fitness score is parametrized, you may change pitch, tone and tempo. Then to main instrumental you may add one of predefined drum parts. 

The purpose of project was to show that even using evolutionary algorithm, program can generate music( maybe not so good, but music:) )
